//! Virtual desktops ("workspaces"), layered on top of [`super::tiling`].
//!
//! Each output keeps its own set of workspaces - a workspace is just a
//! workspace-indexed slot: tiled windows live in [`super::tiling::TilingState`]
//! (already indexed by workspace), and floating windows are tracked here in
//! a small per-workspace registry, since unlike tiled windows their position
//! isn't recomputable from a layout tree and has to be remembered across a
//! hide/show cycle.
//!
//! Two things sit on top of that per-output storage:
//!
//! - **Mode** ([`crate::config::WorkspaceMode`]): in `PerMonitor` mode,
//!   switching workspaces only touches the output the switch was requested
//!   on. In `Combined` mode, every output is switched to the same index at
//!   once, so all monitors always show "workspace N" together (GNOME-style).
//!   Moving a window to an adjacent workspace always targets the window's
//!   own output in both modes - workspaces don't relocate windows across
//!   monitors, only across slots on their own.
//! - **Dynamic growth**: if enabled, navigating or moving a window past the
//!   last workspace creates a new one on demand, and trailing empty
//!   workspaces are pruned back down again automatically (GNOME-style).
//!   Otherwise the workspace count is fixed.
