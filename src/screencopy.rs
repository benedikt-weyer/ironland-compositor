//! Real-time output capture backing `ext-image-capture-source-v1`/
//! `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` (both implemented by Smithay itself - see
//! `smithay::wayland::image_capture_source`/`image_copy_capture` - this
//! module only supplies the parts Smithay leaves to the compositor: the
//! actual pixel copy, and this compositor's own permission model).
//!
//! ## Permission model
//!
//! The `ext_output_image_capture_source_manager_v1`/
//! `ext_image_copy_capture_manager_v1` globals themselves are unrestricted
//! (any client can bind them and negotiate a session - session setup alone
//! never reads screen content), *unlike* most other wlroots-style
//! compositors' `wlr-screencopy-v1`, which usually stops there: this
//! compositor gates the one point that actually matters instead, moving
//! consent from the protocol layer to the pixel layer.
//!
//! Every time a client's `ext_image_copy_capture_frame_v1.capture` request
//! would actually read screen content
//! ([`ImageCopyCaptureHandler::frame`][state] in `crate::state`), the
//! requesting client is identified by [`client_identity`] - the executable
//! path behind its Wayland connection, resolved via the kernel and never
//! anything the client itself asserts (see [`client_identity`]'s own doc
//! for exactly how, and why it's more involved than a plain `/proc/<pid>/
//! exe` read). That path is looked up in [`ScreencopyState`]'s grant table:
//!
//! - A prior **Allow** completes the capture immediately.
//! - A prior **Deny**, or no decision yet, fails the capture
//!   ([`CaptureFailureReason::Unknown`]) without reading any pixels. With
//!   no decision on file, it additionally queues an on-screen prompt (see
//!   `crate::permission_prompt`) naming that executable path; the client's
//!   *next* capture attempt (after the user answers - most callers,
//!   including this compositor's own shell's screenshot tool and
//!   `ironland-portal-screenshot`, simply retry on failure) succeeds or
//!   fails accordingly, and the decision is remembered from then on.
//!
//! This means every capturer - this compositor's own shell included - goes
//! through the exact same gate; nothing is special-cased.
//!
//! The grant table is **in-memory only, for this compositor process's own
//! lifetime** - not persisted to disk. A resolved executable path is only a
//! trustworthy, *stable* identity for as long as the binary it names hasn't
//! been replaced or moved since it was granted; nothing on a general-
//! purpose Linux system guarantees that across time (packages get
//! upgraded, distro-specific store/cache paths get rewritten on rebuild,
//! users move their own binaries around). Rather than chase that per
//! packaging scheme - or worse, silently paper over it with a weaker,
//! spoofable match like "same filename" - every grant simply expires when
//! the compositor restarts, which on most setups coincides with exactly
//! the moments (reboot, session restart) such changes tend to land anyway.
//! What's missing to do better is an *actual* kernel-backed persistent
//! identity for "this specific program, even after it's rebuilt/updated" -
//! not something available on Linux today.
//!
//! [state]: crate::state
//!
//! `ironland-portal-screenshot` (the `org.freedesktop.impl.portal.
//! Screenshot` xdg-desktop-portal backend used by sandboxed/third-party
//! apps) is just another caller of this same gate: it runs through its own
//! executable path like anyone else, with its *own*, separate per-`app_id`
//! prompt/grant layer on top (see that binary's module doc) for
//! distinguishing between the different apps it captures on behalf of.
//!
//! ## Pixel capture
//!
//! [`fulfill`] is the actual capture: given pixels already sitting in a
//! readable framebuffer, it reads them back via
//! [`ExportMem::copy_framebuffer`] and copies them into every pending
//! capture frame's client-provided shm buffer. Both backends call it
//! immediately after rendering an output's frame, but get there
//! differently:
//!
//! - `crate::winit`'s bound framebuffer is directly readable, so it calls
//!   [`fulfill`] straight away.
//! - `crate::udev`'s DRM/KMS compositor may instead have scanned a client's
//!   buffer out directly (direct scanout) without ever compositing it into
//!   a readable framebuffer, so `crate::udev::capture_udev_frame` first
//!   re-composites the same `RenderFrameResult` into an offscreen
//!   renderbuffer via `RenderFrameResult::blit_frame_result` (which blits
//!   the scanout plane's dmabuf in like any other element), then calls
//!   [`fulfill`] on that.
